- In order to run all the tests and get the evaluation table run the TestAll.py file
- Any of the other test files can be run but they only produce confusion matrices on their own
- In order to reproduce the feature vectors the Proprocessing.py file can be run (Saved feature vectors were included in the submission as an example)
- Any of the train files can be run to train any of the 4 categories of models (All variations of a given category are trained at once)
- Model architectures are stored in separate files from training and testing
- Naive bayes is never stored as a model as training time is negligible

- Update to README: Tuesday Nov 25th, 8:35pm
- I also just wanted to mention that I used a standard venv virtual environment with python version 3.12.3
